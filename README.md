# Bidirectional LSTM Word Prediction Model

## Overview

This project implements a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to predict the next word in a given text sequence. Using TensorFlow and Keras, the model is designed to learn patterns from a provided dataset and generate coherent text based on those patterns.

## Features

- Bidirectional LSTM architecture for enhanced context understanding.
- Tokenization and preprocessing of input text.
- Capability to predict multiple words iteratively.
- Easy to modify and extend for various text datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pranayyb/Text-Generator.git
cd Text-Generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
